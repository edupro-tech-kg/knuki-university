    paragraphs: [
      "Dear colleagues and students! I congratulate you on the coming New Year! May the Year of the Horse bring peace, and may we live and work in prosperity. I wish 2026 to be a successful year for our country and every family.",
      "The year 2025 was successful for the Kyrgyz National University of Culture and Arts. Guided by the decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic S. N. Zhaparov “National Spirit – Global Summit”, we accomplished a number of important tasks. Based on this decree, we streamlined curricula and drafted a new state standard reflecting this guiding course. Several regulatory documents were developed, and we digitized entrance tests, module and exam questions to reduce human influence.",
      "Document management has been fully transferred to the electronic SED system, and accounting to the centralized “Bukh.Government” system. An online survey was conducted for staff and students to provide feedback on the leadership and faculty. Systematic anti-corruption efforts continue. Together with our workforce and students, we actively implement state programs related to education and culture.",
      "Among the most significant milestones in our history, 2025 stands out. On March 22, 2025, by Presidential Decree No. 96, the B. Beishenalieva Kyrgyz State University of Culture and Arts was granted “national” status. This increased our responsibility; nearly 60 years of dedicated training of cultural professionals and contributions to the country’s cultural life were recognized. We are now tasked with preparing high-quality personnel, integrating into global education, ensuring campus safety, and expanding educational exports.",
      "For the first time, using the university’s own funds, a student cafeteria of 97 m² was built and opened in May. A modern sports hall was constructed in a short time per the personal instruction and support of the Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Kyrgyz Republic, Chairman of the State Committee for National Security, General K. K. Tashiev, and opened on September 17.",
      "In 1993, the K. Moldobasanov Kyrgyz National Conservatory separated from the B. Beishenalieva Kyrgyz State Institute of Arts. The institute’s main academic building was given to the conservatory, with a total area of 1.5 hectares divided unevenly: 0.49 hectares for the institute and 1.1 hectares for the conservatory. On September 10, 2025, 0.37 hectares of that land were returned to the university. Our total area expanded from 0.49 to 0.8642 hectares.",
      "From 1993 until September 2025, we operated in a dormitory-type building. The long-held wish of our staff, who worked in cramped conditions, has come true: by order and support of President Sadyr Nurgozhoevich Zhaparov, with the help of the Chairman of the State Committee for National Security, General Kamchybek Kydyrshaevich Tashiev, construction of a new 10,000 m² modern academic building has begun. Our staff and students are overjoyed.",
      "I want to highlight the contribution of our united team to these historic achievements. As a leader who helped usher the university into a new era, I am happy as well.",
      "During the year, our students won at several national and international festivals, and our scholars participated in conferences. Their work is invaluable in raising the university’s profile globally. With support from the Ministry of Culture, Information and Youth Policy, four scientific-methodological guides and monographs by our scholars were published. We are considering honoraria for researchers studying the history and theory of national culture and arts.",
      "Dear colleagues and students! I want to draw your attention to a very important matter. This year marks exactly 59 years since the university’s founding. Next year we celebrate our 60th anniversary, and we approach it with solid accomplishments. There are still big tasks and responsibilities ahead. We recently received national status, and now we will act according to our strategic development plan. On January 20–21, 2026, we will undergo national accreditation for both programmatic and institutional directions — a crucial milestone.",
      "We intend for KNUCA to obtain special status by 2030. This will allow freer development across several areas: opening new specialties, creating a personnel reserve, increasing salaries, activating student startups, and moving to a “study + practice + income” model. Employment, dual education, double-degree programs, and academic mobility will grow by 10–20%. An agency for education quality and diploma recognition will be established. We plan to collaborate with international accreditation agencies.",
      "The university nurtures humane, talented, creative thinkers who are flexible, multilingual, computer-literate, and able to work with others—competent specialists who meet modern demands. Beyond training creative personnel, we aim to produce works that reduce aggression in society and build resilience against violence among youth. KNUCA graduates receive an additional “pedagogue” qualification, reminding us of the high responsibility creative educators hold. Countering degradation, pessimism, and aggression is our civic and professional duty.",
      "Let us fill every Kyrgyz heart with song, show good role models, capture kind eyes on camera, dance the dance of unity, and foster diplomatic relations among people.",
      "KNUCA invites you to live while feeling the vivid colors of life.",
